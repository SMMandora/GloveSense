# Glove Sense: Gesture Recognition Using Sensor Gloves
Glove Sense is an interactive Streamlit application designed for real-time gesture recognition using sensor-equipped gloves. This tool captures, processes, and utilizes sensor data to train and test machine learning models that can accurately recognize various hand gestures. It's ideal for researchers, developers, and hobbyists interested in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and accessible technologies.

# Features:
Real-time data collection from sensor-equipped gloves.
Data processing and visualization to understand sensor dynamics.
Training and testing with machine learning models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBClassifier) to recognize gestures.
User-friendly interface for managing training sessions and visualizing the recognition process.
Log system to track gesture data and model predictions.

# Setup and Installation:
Ensure Python and Streamlit are installed.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run the application using streamlit run Eight_sensors.py.
